## üöÄ Project Overview

Banking institutions handle massive amounts of loan data. Proper analysis of this data is essential for risk assessment, customer segmentation, and portfolio optimization. This project tackles these challenges by:

- Extracting and transforming raw data using **SQL queries**.
- Creating insightful **KPIs and metrics** that align with business objectives.
- Visualizing data with an **interactive Power BI dashboard** to enhance decision-making processes.

## üìä Problem Statement

Banking executives often struggle to monitor and evaluate loan performance metrics effectively. This project aims to solve this issue by providing:

1. A comprehensive summary of key loan metrics, including:
   - Total Loan Applications
   - Total Funded Amount
   - Total Amount Received
   - Average Interest Rate
   - Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio
2. Insights into **good loans vs bad loans** based on loan statuses.
3. Visualization of trends, such as:
   - Monthly Loan Trends
   - Regional Loan Distribution
   - Loan Purpose Breakdown
4. Granular details on individual loan performance for better portfolio tracking.

## üìÇ Project Structure

### 1. **SQL Analysis**
   - Created a database in SQL Server to store the loan data.
   - Performed data cleaning, transformation, and aggregation using advanced SQL queries.
   - Generated metrics such as:
     - Monthly Loan Applications
     - Good Loan Percentage
     - Funded and Received Amounts by Loan Status

         SUM(loan_amount) AS Total_Funded_Amount, 
         AVG(int_rate) * 100 AS Avg_Interest_Rate 
     FROM 
         bank_loan_data 
     GROUP BY 
         loan_status;
     ```

### 2. **Power BI Dashboard**
   - Imported SQL query results into Power BI.
   - Designed three dashboards:
     1. **Summary Dashboard**: Showcased overall KPIs for loan performance.
     2. **Overview Dashboard**: Highlighted trends across regions, purposes, and time periods.
     3. **Details Dashboard**: Provided granular insights into individual loan metrics.
   - Included filters for dynamic analysis (e.g., by loan grade, region, or purpose).
